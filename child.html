            The main symptoms of coronavirus are:
          
                <li>a high temperature</li>
                <li>a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot, for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours</li>
                <li>a loss or change to sense of smell or taste – this means they cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal</li>
          <h1 style="color: #102027; opacity: 84%;">What to do if your child has symptoms</h1>
          If your child has any of the main symptoms of coronavirus:
          <li>Get a test to check if they have coronavirus as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>Stay at home and do not have visitors until you get the test result – only leave your home to have a test.
