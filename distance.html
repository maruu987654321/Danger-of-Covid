              <p>
                You can spread the virus even if you do not have symptoms.<br>
                        <strong>try to stay at least 2 metres (3 steps) away from anyone you do not live with (or anyone not in your support bubble)</strong><br>
                        <strong>wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds

                        </strong><br>
                        <strong>use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available

                        </strong><br>
                        <strong>wash your hands as soon as you get home
                        </strong><br>
                        <strong>cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze


                        </strong><br>
                        <strong>put used tissues in the bin immediately and wash your hands afterwards


                        </strong><br>

              <h3 style="color: #102027; opacity: 84%;">Face coverings  </h3>
              <p>
                If you can, wear something that covers your nose and mouth in places where it's hard to stay away from other people.
                There are some places where you must wear a face covering, such as:<br>
                <strong>on public transport</strong><br>
                <strong>in shops


                </strong><br>
                <strong>when you go to hospital appointments or visit someone in hospital


                </strong><br>

            </h3>
              <p>
                Advice about staying safe outside your home, meeting other people and going to work depends on where you live.

                The advice is based on the level of risk from coronavirus in your area. This is known as the local COVID alert level.

                <h3 style="color: #102027; opacity: 84%;">Support bubbles</h3>
                <p>
                    If you live alone or you’re a single parent who lives alone with your children, you can meet with 1 other household without social distancing.

                    This is called a support bubble.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    To help yourself stay well:<br>
                    <strong>get plenty of exercise
</strong><br>
<strong>consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D each day if you're indoors most of the day – this is to keep your bones and muscles healthy
</strong><br>
<strong>try to quit smoking – smoking can make you more likely to get infections like coronavirus and become seriously ill
</strong><br>
<strong>eat a healthy balanced diet
</strong>
