            You can have a test (swab test) to check if you have coronavirus (COVID-19) now.

            <h1 style="color: #102027; opacity: 84%;">Who can get a test?</h1>
            Only get a test if you have coronavirus symptoms or have been asked to get tested.
            You may need to get tested if you're going into hospital for surgery or a procedure. The hospital will arrange this for you. Contact your hospital department if you have any questions.

            If your employer, school or travel company has asked you to get tested, and you do not have symptoms, you can pay for a private test.
