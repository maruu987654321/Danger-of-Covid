            Introducing The Doctors Clinic Group – we evolved from London Doctors Clinic in 2019 to offer private GP services nationwide.<br> <br>As the number of clinics grew within London we also wanted to expand out of London and we now have new clinics in Birmingham and Manchester!<br><br> We offer fast and convenient access to a doctor when you need it.<br><br> We pride ourselves on being flexible so don’t need to switch from your local GP to see a private doctor at The Doctors Clinic Group.<br><br> Our online booking form is easy and simple to use and you can easily see when the next available appointment is so you can even see a doctor on the very same day.<br><br>

Our core service is private GP appointments which range from 15-60 minutes long depending on how much time you feel you need with one of our experienced doctors.<br><br> As well as our private GP appointments we offer a whole host of other services including referral letters, sick notes or fit notes, mental health support and visa medicals.<br><br> Flick through some of other popular services below.<br><br>
At Doctors Clinic Group we offer affordable private healthcare and wellbeing services across the UK. Known as London Doctors Clinic in London, we have 19 clinics.<br><br>

Our aim is to make healthcare accessible and convenient, allowing patients to choose a time and place that suits them.<br><br>

We offer same-day GP appointments, often at short notice, as well as advanced bookings. Our services can be used alongside private medical insurance and your local NHS GP.<br><br>

In addition to this, we also offer a full range of mental wellbeing, secondary care and occupational health services.<br><br>

Our breadth of services and flexible approach mean we provide corporate wellbeing services across different industry sectors.<br><br>
